## Authenticate using Dendrite Vault

Authentication with Dendrite is done via the extension **'Dendrite Vault'**. It's a Chrome extension that extracts your session details from a specifed website so that your agent can log in your service on a separate browser.

This way, you never need to share sensitive details such as passwords with your agent. 

Removing an agent's access for a website it easy â€“ just delete the session in **Dendrite Vault**.
